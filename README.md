ðŸ“š This is a Book recommendation and management project! ðŸ“š 
    Projects goal is to write a simple program with scalability in mind meaning it can be easily expanded later on! If you are a book lover and would like to store books that you have read in your computer you can do that using this program. You can also get reading recommendations based on genre or an author you like! P.S. for further development of this program I would like to add edit functionality to edit books rating in the collection, also I would like to add about option that describes what each selection does, and also maybe in later modules when we learn how to create a website maybe I could use this code as an example for the website what I could store in the website for books collection management.
